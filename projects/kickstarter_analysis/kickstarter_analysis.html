					<p>
						In this project, we worked on a dataset with information about Kickstarter projects from 2009 to 2019.
					</p>
					<p>
						This was one of the projects we did during the neuefische Data Science Bootcamp.
					</p>
					<p>
						The GitHub repository for this project can be found 
						<a href="https://github.com/langer-net/ml-kickstarter-project">here</a>,<br />
						as well as the <a href="https://github.com/langer-net/ml-kickstarter-project/blob/main/ML-project-kickstarter.pdf">
							presentation</a> of the results.

					<ul>
						<li>The goal of this data science project was to identify 
							what makes a Kickstarter project successful.</li>
						<li>With this knowledge, creators could be helped to 
							successfully fund their new projects, which would 
							increase Kickstarter's (our stakeholder) revenue.</li>
						<li>In addition, this would also lead to higher 
							satisfaction among Kickstarter's customers (the creators), 
							as their projects would have higher success rates.</li>
